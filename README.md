# JAVASCRIPT GAME

## About the project
I made this game to submit for the Udacity front end developer nanodegree. This was clone a classic arcade game project. 

## Controls
Press the up key to accelerate and the left and right key to avoid astroids. The point of the game is to get a high score. 

## High score
Your score = SPEED * MULTIPLYER <br>
SPEED - After 4000, your speed increases at a constant rate. So the more you fly around the higher your speed will be. <br>
MULTIPLYER - The maximum multiplyer is 2, and you get this when the ship passes the finish line in the middle. The further you are away from the middle the lower your multiplyer will be.  

## Things I'd like to do
- Make the code much cleaner and more concise. 
- Use prototypes to make the game objects (so that each method doesn't need to be a part of each instace of each object) 
- Add levels in which each time you get a score higher than 10,000 you go to the next level.
- In the other levels make astroids come more frequently and come at different angles.
