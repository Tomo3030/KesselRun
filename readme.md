# Kuiper

Hans Solo's Millennium Falcon allegedly did the Kessel Run in less than 12 parasecs, and that has nothing to do with this game. So this game will now be called Kuiper... after the belt...because of the astroids. 

## About the project
I made this game, graphics and all, to submit to the Udacity front end developer nanodegree. This was for the clone of a classic arcade game project. 

## Controls 
Press the up key to accelerate and the left and right key to avoid astroids. The point of the game is to get a high score. 

## Getting a High-Score
Your score is a product of your SPEED * MULTIPLYER <br>
### SPEED
Press up to accelerate to 4000, after this your speed will accelerate at a constant rate. So the more you fly the faster your speed will be. 
### MULTIPLYER
The maximum multiplyer is 2. You get this when your ship passes the finish line in the middle of the game play area. The farther you are from the middle the lower your multiplyer will be.
